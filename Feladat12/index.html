        <h3>Feladat:</h3>
        <p>Create a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 but not the dividable by 3 in the following order:</p>
        <p>Rools:</p>
        <p>first do not print the first number dividable by 3,</p>
        <p>secondly do not print the second number dividable by 3,</p>
        <p>thirdly do not print the third number dividable by 3, and so on.</p>
        <p>Output:</p>
        <p>1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, ...</p>
        <p>Start to count divisible by 3</p>
        <p>First skip the number 3</p>
        <p>Again start counting. 6 is first and second is 9. By rule 2 skip 9.</p>
        <p>Start again counting. First: 12, second: 15, third: 18. By rule 3 skip 18.</p>
        <p>Continue with rule 1.</p>
